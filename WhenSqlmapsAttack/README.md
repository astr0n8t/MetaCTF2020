# When Sqlmaps Attack!

As an offensive security professional, it's easy to forget what it's like to be defending a network or responding to a breach that uses our tools. Here's a chance to do just that :)

Our web application firewall (WAF) detected someone trying to exploit a SQL injection vulnerability on our website it seems. To help incident response efforts, it took a PCAP while the attacker was sending their malicious requests. We need you to analyze this pcap and figure out what data the user was able to exfil. Note that the flag is not surrounded by MetaCTF{}, but it will be obvious when you find it.
