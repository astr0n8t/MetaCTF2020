# \[REDACTED\]
The CEO of Cyber Corp has strangely disappeared over the weekend. After looking more into his disappearance Local Police Department thinks he might have gotten caught up into some illicit activities.

The IT Department just conducted a search through his company-provided laptop and found an old memo containing a One Time Password to log into his e-mail. However it seems as if someone has redacted the code, can you recover it for us?
