# Watermarked

Sonic watermarks are a security measure used by many different actors in the audio recording industry. Audio engineers sometimes mix them into unfinished tracks in case they are leaked outside of the studio, and developers of VST plugins often manipulate the generated sound to limit those using free trial or cracked versions of their software.

You are an audio engineer working with famous post-lingual rapper Playball Carl, and you've been alerted to a leak that just surfaced on SoundCloud. Recover the watermark to find the identity of the leaker.
